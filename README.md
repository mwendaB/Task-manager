## npm scripts

At root:

- `npm run dev`: Starts both backend and frontend
- `npm run dev-server`: Starts only backend
- `npm run dev-client`: Starts only frontend
- `npm run install-all`: Installs all dependencies and dev-dependencies required at root, at frontend and at backend.

Inside frontend folder:

- `npm start`: Starts frontend in development mode
- `npm run build`: Builds the frontend for production to the build folder
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `npm run eject`: This will remove the single build dependency from the frontend.

Inside backend folder:

- `npm run dev`: Starts backend using nodemon.
- `npm start`: Starts backend without nodemon.
